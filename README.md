Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## CodeBook.md

Read the CodeBook before running the following script.  It discusses the project's input and output data.

## The *run_analysis.R* script

This script downloads the study data to the script's own folder/directory and then produces the output datasets discussed in the CodeBook.

If the script is re-run, it will first remove all artifacts of its previous execution.
